#Creating a Simple Model for Data Analysis
#The most simple model that can be used is one that uses
#A linear regression model.

#We can also use a logistic regression as well
#to create a fairly simple model.

#Another form of modelling is the decision tree:

#Another technique is using the Random Forest,
#As this allows for a more open-ended method for
#tree modelling
